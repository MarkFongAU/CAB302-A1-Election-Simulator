				The model classes are complete, professionally structured and pass both the student-supplied and
				assessment unit tests without error. The GUI runs without error.

				The classes are complete and well structured, but the testing process yields a number of errors which
				may affect operation occasionally. The GUI runs without apparent error for most cases.

				Ability to design and implement professional unit test coverage from a specification under a modern
				unit testing framework.
				<br>(8 marks in total)
			</td>
			<td>
				The testing strategy and test implementation fully exercise the range of operations specified. Each
				non-trivial method has several specified test cases, and the supplied unit tests capture all or almost
				all of the variations in the 'broken' test code. The unit test methods are well designed and take
				advantage of the facilities provided by the test harness.
				<br>(7-8 marks)
			</td>
			<td>
				The strategy exercises the range of operations but the test cases are less complete, with for example
				some obvious boundary or initial cases not considered. The unit test methods are well designed and take
				advantage of the facilities of the test harness, but the supplied unit tests fail to identify some of
				the problems in the broken test code.
				<br>(6 marks)
			</td>
			<td>
				Coverage remains good, but is less complete than at the higher levels. Some methods perhaps have
				inadequate coverage, but the overall strategy is good. The use of the framework is reasonable, but
				perhaps could be better structured.
				<br>(5 marks)
			</td>

			<td colspan="2">
				Coverage is reasonable but there are significant omissions. Some methods are poorly covered, and the
				overall impression is of arbitrary test cases for the sake of completeness rather than as part of
				careful planning. The broken test code reveals many flaws in the strategy.
				<br>(3-4 marks)
			</td>

			<td colspan="2">
				Coverage is weak and in places almost non-existent. There are a number of methods which are barely
				tested at all. The use of the JUnit framework is poor and the supplied tests fail to capture much of
				the aberrant behaviour of the broken test code

				Ability to write code and documentation to a professional standard.
				<br>(5 marks in total)
			</td>

			<td>
				Both the Java model and test code conforms to the standard presented in the supplied classes, interfaces
				and Javadoc. Identifiers are self-documenting, commenting (including Javadoc) is consistent, light and
				aids comprehension. There is appropriate use of whitespace, and indentation is used to enhance
				understanding of structure.
				<br>(5 marks)
			</td>

			<td colspan="2">
				Both the Java model and test code basically conform to the standard, although there are some minor
				inconsistencies, excesses of commenting or poorly chosen identifiers. Identifiers are self-documenting,
				commenting is consistent, light and aids comprehension. Indentation and whitespace are usually
				consistent and an aid to comprehension.
				<br>(3-4 marks)
			</td>

			<td colspan="2">
				There is some attempt to employ good commenting, appropriate use of whitespace and self-documenting
				identifiers but this is often not consistent with the coding standard or itself inconsistently applied.
				Overall effect does not appear professional.
				<br>(2 marks)

			<td colspan="2">
				Documentation is weak or non-existent, identifiers are often poorly chosen and the use of whitespace
				and indentation is poorly considered. Overall impression is very disorganised and unprofessional.

	<div>Good job! <br />
Code quality: No significant issues. White spacing could be a tiny bit more consistent, and commenting can get a little bit excessive in some methods.</div>
